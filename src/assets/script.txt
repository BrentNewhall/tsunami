dm | Hi! I'm Ian. | charCenter: dm-armup | bg: dining-room
dm | I run a D&D game. | charCenter: dm
dm | Yeah, me and every other geek these days, it seems like. | charCenter: dm
dm | I know why youâ€™re here, though. | charCenter: dm
dm | You want to run a D&D game, and you want to run it better. | charCenter: dm
dm | I can help with that. | charCenter: dm
dm | Today, I'm going to talk about starting a new campaign right, with a thing called "Session Zero." | charCenter: dm
dm | But first, let me introduce my players. | charCenter: dm
dm | This is Tara. She's been playing D&D for years. | charLeft: dm | charRight: player1
player1 | Hi! | charLeft: dm | charRight: player1-armup
dm | This is Jesse. She's played some other RPGs before but this is her first time playing D&D. | charLeft: dm | charRight: player2
player2 | Yo. | charLeft: dm | charRight: player2-armup
dm | And this is Keith. He's never played D&D or any other tabletop RPG before. He's our newbie! | charLeft: dm | charRight: player3-neutral
player3 | Uh, hi! I hope I don't mess anything up. | charLeft: dm | charRight: player3-neutral | bg: dining-room
dm | Now, when you start a campaign, you may be thinking you'll just get everyone together, spend an hour or so creating characters, then jump in to a story. | charCenter: dm
dm | And that, my friend, is asking for a complete and utter disaster. | charCenter: dm-neutral
| The End | bg: dining-room
